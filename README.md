## User Guide:
#### Please go through the Details for better understanding and Usability.

- Use 3.7V Lipo battery
- Checkout the silkscreen markings for Battery Polarity
- Be careful while using external power for Raspberry Pi Pico By VSYS. (More Details: https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/pico-datasheet.pdf).
- Use female wires to connect external peripherals.
- Follow Raspberry Pi Pico Guidelines for I/O Voltages

## Software and Programming:
The SDK (Software Development Kit) provides the headers, libraries and build system necessary to write programs for
RP2040-based devices such as Raspberry Pi Pico in C, C++ or Arm assembly language.
The SDK is designed to provide an API and programming environment that is familiar both to non-embedded C
developers and embedded C developers alike. A single program runs on the device at a time with a conventional main()
method. Standard C/C++ libraries are supported along with APIs for accessing RP2040â€™s hardware, including DMA,
IRQs, and the wide variety fixed function peripherals and PIO (Programmable IO).

## Checking software contents of Pico
If you have forgotten what has been programmed into your Raspberry Pi Pico, and the program was built using our Pico C/C++ SDK, it will usually have a name and other useful information embedded into the binary. You can use the Picotool command line utility to find out these details.
